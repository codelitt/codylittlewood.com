The notorious hackers of Sony's Playstation database used Amazon cloud servers to launch their attack, as [reported by Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-15/sony-attack-shows-amazon-s-cloud-service-lures-hackers-at-pennies-an-hour.html) earlier today. One of the individuals used Amazon's Elastic Computer Cloud, or EC2, to hack into Sony's systems and compromise 100 million customer accounts.Amazon's EC2 are well-known for being an inexpensive server solution. The draw for using such a service is an evenly balanced mix of need for anonymity as well as the servers brute power for handling thousands of tasks simultaneously such as cracking passwords.Amazon and cloud computing drew a lot of heat today in Bloomberg's article. Mind you the cloud computing servers that Amazon owns and rents out were not the problem that caused the attack. A lack of security on Amazon's part was not the cause of the attack._Editorial note: The article kind of washes together cloud computing, Amazon, and Sony into one water-colored mess. It poorly portrays the actual security risk and where said risk should be assigned._Cloud computing and Amazon were simply vendors. Sony's lack of security measures and foresight should be more in the spotlight than the technology that was used to access the information. Cloud computing does have some security risks and some new measures are sure to be put in place with coming years. However, the fear should not be coming from the technology. As new technologies emerge so will new hacks. As new hacks emerge so does new technology. This has always been the cycle. Being aware of the risks is healthy, but being afraid of them just impedes progress.
