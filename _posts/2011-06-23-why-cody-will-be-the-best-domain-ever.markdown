Well, it won't to be quite blunt. However, ICANN is going to allow for anyone to apply for a domain now. Of course, big tech giants and large cities will be the first to climb this Everest of Geekery. The applicant must show vast technical capacity and pay the small fee of $186,000, so it is highly unlikely I will acquire it. Given the opportunity though, this ego-trip would keep my large head inflated for quite some time.
