title: The End of an Era -- Official Resignation From MyLingo

After a great deal of consideration, consultation and thought, I'm resigning as Chief Communications Officer at MyLingo and the parent company Liquid Designers for a new position for a U.S.-based Fortune 500 working on their digital strategy with an extremely talented group of people. My colleagues at MyLingo were notified over a week ago and we've been working together to create a seamless transition while they find my replacement.

I absolutely owe the world to the highly intelligent people of MyLingo. I've learned a mountain of information from the brilliant minds of the dev and business teams. They've pushed me to excel and explore in new areas of my work. I would never be where I am today without their original thoughts and creative vision.

As much as I would love to stay with them and continue to work side by side, I think this new opportunity will be a great place to further build upon my research, to grow and to continue with my career. There always comes a time when the end of an age comes fruition, and this is a chapter that was well-written, but has come to a close. I am looking forward to a new team and a new set of challenges in the upcoming months. I will continue to utilize my off time on my consulting work, my Pro Bono work, and my side projects.
