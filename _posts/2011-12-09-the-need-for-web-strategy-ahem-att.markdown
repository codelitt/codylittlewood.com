AT&T is participating in PPC search and ad campaigns on the web to reach a Hispanic market. This is fantastic and I applaud their efforts. I, speaking Spanish and visiting my friends in Puerto Rico, wanted to know if my plan was covered in PR while on vacation or if I would be roaming. I did a search for "mobile plans AT&T Puerto Rico," but in Spanish "planes movil AT&T Puerto Rico" I received sponsored results/ads shown below:

This is fine and dandy right? Well look where it redirects:

It just has you shaking your head in disbelief. For those of you who missed it, AT&T advertises special offers in sponsored results _in Spanish_, and then doesn't actually have supporting content in Spanish on their site.

I wouldn't expect a huge tech and telecom company to miss so badly. Fire that guy. Then fire the QA guy. You're throwing away money if you advertise in one language, and then don't actually the landing page/lead conversion in the same language.
